## 🧙‍♂️ What Can BloomBot Do?

BloomBot blends code and creativity to offer an arcane suite of features:

| Feature           | Description                                                                                                         |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🔮 **Automation** | Automate repetitive tasks like a background spell — fast, silent, and reliable.                                     |
| 🌟 **Moderation** | Keep order with mute, ban, and filter spells that ward off chaos.                                                   |
| 🎵 **Music**      | Bring harmony to your group with audio magic — summon tracks with ease.                                             |
| 🎮 **Games**      | Engage your community with mini-games, trivia, and bonding magic.                                                   |
| 💡 **400+ Spells**| Explore an expansive library of commands. Fun, useful, weird — you name it, we’ve probably enchanted it.             |

## ⚠️ Use With Wisdom

> With great magic comes great responsibility...

BloomBot is **not affiliated with WhatsApp**. It’s your duty, noble adventurer, to use it **responsibly** and **avoid dark arts** like spamming.  
If you get banned by the Kingdom of Meta, no Phoenix Down can save you.

⚔️ Modified forks or tampered plugins? Proceed at your own peril — the dev guild only supports the original spellbook.
