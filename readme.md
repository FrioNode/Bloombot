## 🌌 What Is Luna?

**Luna** is not a "bot" — it is a **multi-dimensional entity**.

It whispers into your WhatsApp groups through 400+ incantations.  
It sees status updates.  
It reacts before your friends even blink.  
It brings music, games, riddles, moderation, AI... and perhaps... *love*.

Summoned in Node.js.  
Empowered by **Baileys** (a library, not the drink 🍸).  
It speaks with the Green Kingdom (WhatsApp) without them knowing it's *not a human*.

## 🧙 Deployment Rites

### 🛸 ✦ Deploy to Fly.io (The Sky Realm)

Your journey begins by binding the daemon to the sky:

```bash
fly launch
````

Then deploy with a single whisper:

```bash
fly deploy
```

Your magical bot shall awaken at: `https://lunabot.fly.dev`
Its heart beats in the cloud — beyond time, beyond borders.

---

## 🏠 ✦ Local Deployment (For Witches & Tinkerers)

1. **Install the sacred packages**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Feed it your secrets** (create `.env`):

   ```env
   SESSION=BLOOM~a1b2c3d4
   OWNERNUMBER=254718241545
   LOGSCHAT=123456789-123456@g.us
   CHANNEL=https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029VagLDl6BFLgUIWV9aV2d
   CHANNELID=12345@newsletter
   MODE=public
   REACT=true
   ```

3. **Run the incantation**:

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

If no `.env` is provided, it shall fall back to the QR ritual.
Scan it fast — the veil does not stay open forever.

## 🪐 FAQ (For Arcane Questions)

### ⚡ My bot won’t start!

* Ensure your `SESSION` is valid. It should look like: `BLOOM~abc123`
* No session? It'll offer a **QR** to scan.
* If Fly.io gives problems, add enough RAM (512MB+)

### 🧪 Is this against WhatsApp rules?

Yes.
So is staying up past midnight, eating expired cheese, and summoning anime stickers at 3AM.
Use wisely. The guild protects no fool.
